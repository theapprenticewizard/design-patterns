# Creational Patterns
As the name suggests creational patterns exist to aide in the creation of an object.  
Sometimes this is in order to provide advanced features such as caching to an object
or sometimes its for simply delegating the creation of an object to another object.
Creational patterns often can make code more concise by creating objects in a more 
semantic fashion.  For example, the builder pattern can make the creation of objects
with many properties far easier to read.
